# Zed Editor for Unity

This is a fork of a homemade package to integrate [Zed](https://zed.dev) as Unity external script editor.

The purpose of the fork is to support Windows platforms.
Not tested on MacOS or linux yet so it is unknown if the original plugins functionality on those platforms still works.
Use the original plugin for MacOS and linux.

Original plugin: https://github.com/maligan/unity-zed

```sh
# 1. Via PackageManger & GitHub URL
https://github.com/Edersteiner/zed-editor-for-unity.git

# 2. Via copy this repository content into Packages/ folder
```
